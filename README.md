# A* visual in p5.js
An A* path-finding algorithm displayed visually with p5.js.

Visual can be seen on my site [here](https://tyrelh.github.io/a-star-p5js/). I might improve the UI of this page in the future, but currently just refresh the page to run again. If the screen goes black then no path exists for that iteration of the map, just refresh to generate a new one.

This project was developed to help me learn and understand A*.

I followed Daniel Shiffman work through this example in his [3 part YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k&t=1762s) on A*. He also has an updated and fancy [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodingTrain/AStar) for this project that differs quite a bit from what he does in his videos.
